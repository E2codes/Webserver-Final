# Webserver-Final
In the progress screenshots folder you can see the steps I took during this assignment.
During the midterm I initally started in HTML
For the final I decided to use PHP with MySQL
Unfortunatly after creating and connecting the database I have run into an issue with the directory index configuration in Apache. 

When I go to my localhost I end up with a Forbidden Error
